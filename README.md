# About me:
Hi, my name is Debasish Panda. I am a graduate student in Data Science from Bellevue University, Nebraska. I work as a Principal Application Engineer in Discover Financial Services which is my full-time job. I have around 13 years of experience in software development for banking and financial industry in various capacities. Since this industry is considered one of the largest producer and consumer of customer data on a daily basis, I am looking forward to leverage my data science knowledge to provide meaningful insights to my employer so that it will help them to create better financial future for our customers and impact their life in a positive way.

I am a proud father of two beautiful kids, a committed husband, a caring son and a grateful citizen. While I am not working, I love to explore new places, read books, spend time with my family, play tennis or badminton. Cooking is one of my favorite stress busters and I love preparing new dishes.
