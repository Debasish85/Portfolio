## About me:
Hi, my name is Debasish Panda. I am a graduate student in Data Science from Bellevue University, Nebraska. I work as a Principal Application Engineer in Discover Financial Services which is my full-time job. I have around 13 years of experience in software development for banking and financial industry in various capacities. Since this industry is considered one of the largest producer and consumer of customer data on a daily basis, I am looking forward to leverage my data science knowledge to provide meaningful insights to my employer so that it will help them to create better financial future for our customers and impact their life in a positive way.

I am a proud father of two beautiful kids, a committed husband, a caring son and a grateful citizen. While I am not working, I love to explore new places, read books, spend time with my family, play tennis or badminton. Cooking is one of my favorite stress busters and I love preparing new dishes.

This portfolio provides my journey in the world of Data Science and has link to my Github reposiroties where you can find the projects that I have undertaken during this course. 


#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, R, Spark,Jupyter, OCP, IBM Mainframes.

## Projects:
### Classification model for auto-identification of Microbes
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Classification-model-for-auto-identification-of-Microbes)

Bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a significant health risk. Hence, rapid identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become paramount in saving lives and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. In patients with septic shock from bacterial infections, identification of antibiotic-resistance genes is essential because the mortality rate increases 7.6% per hour of delay in administering correct antibiotics. Unfortunately, it takes more than 24 h to grow up the bacteria recovered from the blood of an infected patient, identify the species, and then determine to which antibiotics the organism is resistant, leading to a very high mortality rate for such infections.Hence, this project is aiming to employ machine learning to rapidly classify microbes using measurements of cellular features generated from microscopic imagery.

### Stroke Prediction
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Stroke-Prediction)

This objective of this project is to design a robust system that works efficiently and will be able to predict the possibility of Stroke accurately. This project is going to use some of the prediction modelling techniques to predict whether a given person is likely to have a stroke or not based on the risk factors.

### Airline Safety
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Airline-Safety)

Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the downward trends of airline safety. We will be taking data and statistics into consideration and find out what is the truth.
