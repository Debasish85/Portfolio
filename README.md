## About me:
Hi, my name is Debasish Panda. I am a graduate student in Data Science from Bellevue University, Nebraska. I work as a Principal Application Engineer in Discover Financial Services which is my full-time job. I have around 13 years of experience in software development for banking and financial industry in various capacities. Since this industry is considered one of the largest producer and consumer of customer data on a daily basis, I am looking forward to leverage my data science knowledge to provide meaningful insights to my employer so that it will help them to create better financial future for our customers and impact their life in a positive way.

I am a proud father of two beautiful kids, a committed husband, a caring son and a grateful citizen. While I am not working, I love to explore new places, read books, spend time with my family, play tennis or badminton. Cooking is one of my favorite stress busters and I love preparing new dishes.

This portfolio provides my journey in the world of Data Science and has link to my Github reposiroties where you can find the projects that I have undertaken during this course. 


#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, R, Spark,Jupyter, OCP, IBM Mainframes.

## Projects:
### Classification model for auto-identification of Microbes
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Classification-model-for-auto-identification-of-Microbes)

Bacterial antibiotic resistance has become a significant health risk. Hence, rapid identification of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has become paramount in saving lives and reduce the spread of antibiotic resistance. In patients with septic shock from bacterial infections, identification of antibiotic-resistance genes is essential because the mortality rate increases 7.6% per hour of delay in administering correct antibiotics. Unfortunately, it takes more than 24 h to grow up the bacteria recovered from the blood of an infected patient, identify the species, and then determine to which antibiotics the organism is resistant, leading to a very high mortality rate for such infections.Hence, this project is aiming to employ machine learning to rapidly classify microbes using measurements of cellular features generated from microscopic imagery.

### Stroke Prediction
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Stroke-Prediction)

This objective of this project is to design a robust system that works efficiently and will be able to predict the possibility of Stroke accurately. This project is going to use some of the prediction modelling techniques to predict whether a given person is likely to have a stroke or not based on the risk factors.

### Airline Safety
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Airline-Safety)

Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air is no longer a safe way to travel. The news and media outlets have been bombarding the public with reports and figures about the downward trends of airline safety. We will be taking data and statistics into consideration and find out what is the truth.

### Congressional Resignation
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/Congressional-Resignation)
For any electoral campaign management company to run a successful campaign, avoid the problem of an unsuccessful campaign, and to ensure successful office election CampaignMe will gather and analyze prior candidate history, including resignation history in past offices held. CampaignMe (the campaign management company) is looking to take on candidates with the highest probability of winning elections, and devise strategies to ensure that they will get elected.
Hence, we are going to leverage the congressional resignation data set to find out resigning member’s party and district, the date they resigned, the reason for their resignation and the source of the information about their resignation.

### World GDP Data
[Repo](https://github.com/Debasish85/World-GDP-Data)

GDP is an important measurement for economists and investors because it tracks changes in the size of the entire economy. In addition to serving as a comprehensive measure of economic health, GDP reports provide insights about the factors driving economic growth or holding it back.  I have used Web scraping to fetch data from IMF’s website (for GDP data) and Worldometer’s website for population data to find relationship between data sets.
